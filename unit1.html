<h1>Get started on Twitch.tv</h1>
<h2>The views</h2>
<p>Twitch is sorted by amount of views that people have while streaming. If I wanted to watch Fortnite for example, the first people I would see
are the people that have thousands of viewers at that time. I would have to scroll down a lot of the page to find anyone with around two viewers.
Almost nobody is going to scroll down all the way just to watch some random person play the game when they could watch the main people that play it 
and have a lot better content.</p>
<h2>What steps can <i>you</i> take to get started on Twitch?</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Purchase the equipment necessary to stream and run the games you want to play</li>
  <li>Start gaining a following on other social media platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube</li>
  <li><b>START STREAMING</b></li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h2>Some tips to get started</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Be consistent with your streaming schedule</li>
	<li>Become a social person.</li>
	<li>Advertise your stream whenever you can and is appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Doing these things will help you gain traction in the streaming field. Being social is a must in this line of work.
<br/>
Nobody will ever know about your content unless you tell them about it</p>
