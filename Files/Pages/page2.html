        <p>Memberships are basically like subscriptions from Twitch. Viewers pay a monthly fee (usually about $5.00) to the streamer and receive some kind of benefits. This could include emoticons and ad-free viewing.</p>
        <p>Ads, once again, give a small amount of money to the streamer for every person that watches one on the channel. YouTube has a better ad deal as ads can play for anyone (that does not have YouTube premium) on any video that the content creator has uploaded to YouTube. This is why YouTube has better passive income.</p>
        <p>Donations, again, are figures of currency that viewers send directly to the streamer</p>
