        <p>Ads are among the most common type of revenue on any platform. Ads through Twitch give about a 50-50 cut from streamer to company as far as I understand as of right now.</p>
        <p>Bits are like coins. Every 1 bit is transfered as 1 cent to the streamer. (100 bits would be $1)</p>
        <p>Subscriptions are a type of membership on Twitch. As a Twitch affiliate, the cut will be somewhere around 50-50. So for a tier 1 ($5.00 subscription) the streamer would get $2.50 and Twitch would get $2.50. As a Twitch partner, the cut goes up to somewhere around 70-30 in favor of the streamer.</p>
        <p>Donations are exactly what they say. This is money given from viewers straight to the streamer</p>
